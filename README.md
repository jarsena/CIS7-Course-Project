Documentation – CIS7 Course Project, Case 3

The case I'm taking on in this project involves creating a program which, through algorithms, can encrypt and decrypt phrases using a Vigenère cipher.

The prompts the program gives will walk you through most of it; apart from those instructions, you need to make sure that the phrases you enter are all uppercase letters with no spaces as the program currently can't handle lowercase letters, spaces or numbers.
